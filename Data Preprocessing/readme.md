## Introduction
#### Data preprocessing is a technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues. Data preprocessing prepares raw data for further processing.
## Need of Data Preprocessing
#### For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a proper manner. Some specified Machine Learning model needs information in a specified format, for example, Random Forest algorithm does not support null values, therefore to execute random forest algorithm null values have to be managed from the original raw data set.


## Libraries used for the Data Preprocessing 
#### Pandas: to read the input files.
#### Imputer: Imputation transformer for completing missing values in the dataset.
#### LabelEncoder: Encode labels with value between 0 and n_classes-1.
#### OneHotEncoder: Encode categorical integer features using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme
#### train_test_split: Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets
#### StandardScaler: Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.Standardization is a useful technique to transform attributes with a Gaussian distribution and differing means and standard deviations to a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
