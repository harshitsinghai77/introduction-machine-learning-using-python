## Introduction
#### In simple words multiple linear regression is predicting the value of a variable Y (dependent variable) based on multiple variables X (independent variable) provided there is a linear relationship between X and Y
Is same as Simple Linear Regression but with many independent variable. As:

y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + …….. + b<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> <br>
where y is the dependent variable <br>
and x<sub>1</sub> ….. x<sub>n</sub> are the independent variables

## Assumptions of Linear Regression:
1. Linearity
2. Homoscedasticity
3. Multivariate Normality
4. Independence of errors
5. Lack of multicollinearity

## Libraries Used
#### sklearn.preprocessing and 
#### sklearn.model_selection
#### sklearn.linear_model
#### LinearRegression: Ordinary least squares Linear Regression.
#### statsmodels.formula.api

## Aim
#### Develop and train the machine learning model to predict the profit based on various factors like R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and State	

## Dataset
#### 50_Startups.csv is enclosed with the folder. The X column of the dataset contains the 'R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and	State' along with 'Profit' of the startups.
